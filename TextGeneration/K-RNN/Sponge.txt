Narrator: A slow day at the Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, check this out. [holds up a patty in each hand] Two ordinary Krabby Patties, but when expertly tossed with the skill of a champ, they become... [throws them on the floor and Patrick slides the patties across the room]
Patrick: A one-way ticket to PAIN! [slams into the wall by Mr. Krabs' office. Mr. Krabs' window breaks off the wall caused by the impact.]
Mr. Krabs: Huh? [puts down his writing]
SpongeBob: [slides while on Patrick's mouth] Heave-ho! [slams into the wall and the place shakes]
Mr. Krabs: [exits his office] What the devil fish is going on out here?! [SpongeBob is on Patrick's mouth] Time is money! And if you boys is wasting time, then you're wasting money! [walks up to SpongeBob] And that's just sick!
SpongeBob: But we were performing a ritual to attract customers. And the only way the ritual can work is for us to get hurt. Real bad.
Mr. Krabs: What stupid barnacle told you that?
Squidward: Uhh… [nervously covers his face up with a magazine]
Mr. Krabs: Listen, instead of killing yourselves, I've got something real important for you to do for me. [scene cuts to the three of them standing in front of Mr. Krabs' house] Now, are you men ready for your super...
SpongeBob and Patrick: Superrrr...!
Mr. Krabs: ...special...
SpongeBob and Patrick: ...speciallll...!
Mr. Krabs: [whispers] ...secret...
SpongeBob and Patrick: [whisper] ...seeeeecret...
Mr. Krabs: ...assignment?
SpongeBob and Patrick: [screaming] Assignment?!? I beg of you, Mr. Krabs! Put us out of our misery! [SpongeBob and Patrick get worried]
Mr. Krabs: The two of you are to paint the inside of me house! [opens his front door]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Yay! [both jump out with excitement]
Mr. Krabs: [charges them from the right, in a stern tone] But, let me give you two a warning. [holds up two buckets of paint] This here paint is absolutely permanent. [shoves cans toward SpongeBob and Patrick] It will never come off. [angrily] So if I see even one drop on anything but wall, I'll have your rear ends cut off... [holds up two empty plaques, each with their names on it] …and mounted over me fireplace! So, have fun with the job. [shuts the door with them inside his house]
SpongeBob: Patrick?
Patrick: Yeah, SpongeBob? [They see Mr. Krabs' wall; it is covered head to toe in memorabilia]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs sure has a lot of expensive treasures to drip paint on. [puts his paint on the floor] Do you think we should take this stuff off the walls?
Patrick: [puts his paint on the floor as well] No way, SpongeBob. We're not getting paid to move stuff.
SpongeBob: Patrick, we're not getting paid at all.
Patrick: Well, that's what I said! We're not getting paid and that's final.
SpongeBob: Okay, we'll just paint around all this stuff.
Patrick: Good, just don't pay me.
SpongeBob: First, we need to set up the tarp. [holds up a tarp]
Patrick: Tarp ahoy! [spreads the tarp on the floor, but the camera pans to reveal it's a tiny piece]
SpongeBob: We're gonna need more coverage, Patrick. [scene cuts to more tarp on the floor but not the entire floor] Now that's what I'm talking about! [nervous tone] Well, I guess we should open these cans of permanent paint now.
Patrick: That will never ever come off.
SpongeBob: And if we get it on anything, Mr. Krabs will cut our butts off.
Patrick: And mount them on the wall. [SpongeBob takes a screwdriver and tries opening the lid] Careful, SpongeBob. Careful, SpongeBob. SpongeBob, careful. Careful, SpongeBob. Careful, SpongeBob! Careful, SpongeBob! [screaming] CAREFUL, SPONGEBOB!!!
SpongeBob: [holds the lid] Patrick, the lid's already off.
Patrick: Oh... [happily] now it's my turn! [takes out a battle ax and hits the paint can with it. SpongeBob grabs the can]
SpongeBob: [nervously] I'm thinking I should do this one, too, Patrick.
[SpongeBob carefully opens the lid with same screwdriver as before. The lid opens, and a blob of paint jumps out. SpongeBob and Patrick scream. The blob bounces off a piece of tarp. SpongeBob and Patrick scream louder. The blob bounces off eight pieces of tarp, then lands back into the can]
Patrick: Well, that was a rip-off. [SpongeBob wipes sweat off]
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, let's get our brushes ready. [holds up his big brush] Uhh, maybe we should start with a smaller brush. [throws the big brush to the right of him then takes another small brush and gets a hair out of his nose. Patrick gets all his hairs out of his nose on his brush. SpongeBob dips the brush into the can and then faces the wall] All right, Patrick, gotta get started painting this wall. With the permanent paint that we're not allowed to get on anything but the wall. Well, here we go...
Narrator: One hour later.
SpongeBob: [still standing in the same spot, while sweating nervously] ...Just a few more seconds of mental preparation and I'll be painting this wall!
Narrator: Two hours later.
SpongeBob: [still standing in the same spot and sweating] ...I'm getting to the painting...
Narrator: Three hours later. [the camera zooms out to reveal Patrick holding the timecard. Patrick is also sweating]
Patrick: [to SpongeBob] Can you move it along? I'm all out of time cards.
SpongeBob: [still standing on the same spot and sweating] No problem. Here I go. [makes a line of paint going down the wall. He smiles. The paint starts going down, but SpongeBob blows it one direction then another then another until he gets a blow dryer and blows the paint off the wall. Blows the steam off the hairdryer like a gun creating a giant paint bubble] Yeah. Huh?! [notices the big paint bubble] Barnacles! What could be worse than a giant paint bubble?!
Patrick: Oh, I know... [takes a wand, dips it in the paint then blows a big bubble] TWO giant paint bubbles!
SpongeBob: Noooooo!! [two giant paint bubbles merge into one] Patrick?
Patrick: Yeah, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: I don't think this bubble can get much bigger.
Patrick: [finds a bicycle pump and attaches it to the bubble] Nonsense! [starts pumping the bubble, inflating it further]
SpongeBob: Pat, no!! [The bubble pops and the paint splatters all over the wall, covering up all the old brown spots. SpongeBob moves out of the way for the last bit of paint to splash on the wall] We did it! [checks the area] We painted the whole house! And without getting a drop of paint on anything but th-- [shocked] FLAPPIN' FLOTSAM, WHAT'S THAT!?!?!?!?! [Mr. Krabs' dollar on the wall has a dot of paint on it upon closer inspection. SpongeBob's eyes crack, break, and drip on the floor. He then falls over. He then wakes up and his eyes recover] We're dead, Patrick! Do you know what that is?
Patrick: Hmm... it's a dollar. I win!
SpongeBob: That's not just a dollar. It's Mr. Krabs' first dollar! His most prized possession! And we got paint on it!
Patrick: I think you are over-reacting, SpongeBob, I don't see any paint.
SpongeBob: Okay, [takes the dollar off the wall] this isn't a problem. Maybe I can just wipe it off. [tries to wipe the paint off with his tie but makes the paint even more noticeable] There! I think I got it. [notices the paint more. He becomes nervous so he wipes it more but the dollar becomes completely covered in paint. He screams]
Patrick: Oh, now I see it!
SpongeBob: This is not good, Patrick! This is not good! Mr. Krabs is gonna be home soon! And when he sees what we did to his first dollar… [scene cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick's butt on the wall while Mr. Krabs is enjoying some tea by the fire]
Both: [while holding their butts] AAAAAHHHHHH!!!!
Patrick: Wait, SpongeBob, all we got to do is wash the paint off and Krabs will never know!
SpongeBob: But Mr. Krabs said...
Patrick: [claps his hands over SpongeBob's mouth] Forget what Mr. Krabs said! Every paint comes off with something! [scene cuts to SpongeBob standing by a washing machine]
SpongeBob: Did it work? [Patrick comes out from the washing machine with the dollar, still with paint on it, in his hands; he also has a bra on his head]
Patrick: Nope. [scene cuts to SpongeBob sanding the dollar in Patrick's hand]
SpongeBob: Did it work? [Patrick's hands are gone]
Patrick: Nope.
Patrick: [scene cuts to SpongeBob squirting sulfuric acid out of a fire hose. Patrick screams in pain]
SpongeBob: Did it work? [Patrick holds up the dollar that left a hole in his body from the force of the acid, except for the part blocked by his arms]
Patrick: Nope. [scene cuts to SpongeBob banging on the dollar Patrick is holding, while Patrick is wearing a neck brace and has a black eye; behind them is a huge assortment of weapons and tools that apparently didn't work either] Oof! Oof! Oof!
SpongeBob: [holds a club] Nothing's working!
Patrick: Wait, SpongeBob, we're not cavemen! [walks over to a computer] We have technology! [picks up the computer and angrily grunts as he smashes it on the dollar]
SpongeBob: It didn't work.
Patrick: [Ranting as he puts the computer down] This is all Mr. Krabs' fault! If he hadn't hung that stupid dollar in the first place...! I mean, it's not like it looks any different than a regular dollar. Why hang it? You could just stick any old dollar bill up on the wall, no one would even know the difference! You might as well reach in my wallet, pull out a dollar, and put it on the wall! And it would...
SpongeBob: Hurry, Patrick, take out your wallet.
Patrick: I don't see where you're going with this... [takes out his wallet and pulls out a dollar] Hey, a dollar!
SpongeBob: Our butts are saved, Patrick! Now all we have to...Patrick!! No! [Patrick puts his dollar in a vending machine] PATRICK, NO! WHY DID YOU PUT IT... [his dollar comes out] AHH! GRAB IT, PAT, GRAB IT! HURRY, HURRY! I... [Patrick pushes it back in] Aww, Pat, no, no! [dollar comes out again] GET IT, PAT! GET IT! GET IT, GET IT! [Patrick forcefully shoves it back in again with both hands.] No-o-o-o-oh!
Patrick: [eats a chocolate bar as he approaches an annoyed SpongeBob] ...Wanna bite?
SpongeBob: Okay, okay, we still have time! [looks in a mirror] Don't panic, SpongeBob, panic is the enemy. You are strong. Through your strength, you shall overcome! [Mr. Krabs is approaching the door while singing, offscreen]
SpongeBob's reflection: You're on your own, pal. [walks away]
SpongeBob: [screams as he runs in circles around Patrick] Hurry, Patrick, put Mr. Krabs' dollar back on the wall! I got an idea! [Mr. Krabs enters his dark house where all the lights are off]
Mr. Krabs: What the…?
SpongeBob: [stammering] We're all done, sir. Everything looks great.
Patrick: Yeah, you don't have to look around. We already did that for you. [lights turn on; they are grinning suspiciously]
Mr. Krabs: You both look like you got a dirty little secret. Ha! I'm kidding. Let's see how you did. Oh, not bad boys, not bad. A nice even coat, high gloss, no bubbles.
SpongeBob: Yeah, looks great, Mr. Krabs. We'll just be going... [he and Patrick are about to leave]
Mr. Krabs: Flippin' fish fossils! Look what you did!
SpongeBob: [stops leaving as he and Patrick kneel down and beg] Oh, Mr. Krabs, we're so sorry! Don't de-butt me! Don't de-butt me!
Patrick: [begging] Mr. Krabs, I'm sorry! Have mercy! Have mercy!
Mr. Krabs: Sorry? You dusted all my knickknacks! That was really nice. Great Barrier Reef! What's this?
SpongeBob: [begging] That's not our fault, Mr Krabs!
Patrick: [begging] We didn't do it on purpose!
Both: [begging] Accident! Accident! Accident! Accident!
Patrick: [begging] I don't want to be butt-less!
Mr. Krabs: Oh, and I suppose the floor molding just painted itself on its own. [wall is decorated with tiny ships] That's what I call craftsmanship. Criminy jim-jam! you messed up my dollar!... [runs over to a bunch of dolls lined up perfectly, except one] ...rama! [Patrick and SpongeBob are confused] All the dolls in this doll-a-rama were perfectly aligned! [straightens one of the dolls to an upright position]
Doll: Mama.
Mr. Krabs: And you boys thought I wouldn't notice! Oh well, I guess no harm done. All right, boys, you're free to go. [runs into a long pile of paintings] Ow! That's funny, I don't remember a stack of painting jutting from the wall where me first dollar used to be. In fact, I don't remember this painting at all. [takes the painting of a crying clown off] Or this one. [takes the painting of a car race off] Or this one. [takes the painting off. SpongeBob and Patrick are anxious] Or this one. [takes it off] Or this one. [takes it off] Or this one. [takes the painting of a banana off] Or this one. [takes a painting of Painty the Pirate off. SpongeBob is behind the painting he just took off]
SpongeBob: Hi, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, what are you doing?
SpongeBob: Oh, you know, just hanging around.
Patrick: [gives a thumbs-down] Boooooooooooo.
Mr. Krabs: Get down onto the floor, boy. [SpongeBob stretches his body to the floor. Mr. Krabs is now annoyed] Alright, now you're just being silly.
SpongeBob: [Mr. Krabs takes him off the wall and throws him aside] No, No, Mr. Krabs! No! Don't look, it's a trick!
Mr. Krabs: [angrily] Did you two get paint all over me first dollar?
SpongeBob: We're sorry, Mr. Krabs!
Patrick: We're so sorry!
Mr. Krabs: [looks at the dollar again then looks at SpongeBob and Patrick] And then did you draw on it with crayon?! [two dollar signs and a smiley face are drawn on the dollar with crayon. SpongeBob turns to Patrick, who is grinning nervously]
Patrick: [holding a green crayon] I thought, you know, maybe he'd buy it?
Mr. Krabs: All right, boys! You know what I've got to do now?
SpongeBob: You mean our butts?
Patrick: Can I use mine one last time? [Mr. Krabs takes the dollar and licks it. The paint comes off then Mr. Krabs puts the dollar back up on the wall]
Mr. Krabs: There we go, good as new.
Both: [They are shocked beyond belief. Stammering] But, but, but, but, but, but, but, but...
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, I lied. This paint actually comes off with saliva! [laughs]
SpongeBob: [frowns then smiles] Oh, I get it, Mr. Krabs. You told us the paint was permanent so me and Patrick would be more careful and not get paint on anything!
Mr. Krabs: Nah, I just like to mess with ya! [Laughs. SpongeBob scowls. He and Patrick glare at Mr. Krabs; they storm out in disgust. Mr. Krabs laughs so hard he spits all over the walls] The old man's still got it! [continues laughing, but the paint comes off the wall from all the spit. He finally stops laughing to see his whole place a mess] Aww, crud. I really gotta learn to say it, not spray it.

SpongeBob: Hi, mailman!

[The mailman yells in fear, and runs off.]

SpongeBob: Okay, [gets out of the mailbox] see you tomorrow!

[Patrick walks up.]

Patrick: Hey, the mail's here! What did you get?

SpongeBob: Let's see... [looks through the mail] Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary, hey! A magazine! [looks at the magazine] That's funny, I don't remember subscribing to Fancy Living Digest.

SpongeBob and Patrick: [look inside the magazine] Whoa!

SpongeBob: Look at all these glossy depictions of a higher standard of living!

[A picture of a rich person's swimming pool is shown.]

SpongeBob: This guy's so rich, he has a swimming pool in his swimming pool!

[A picture is shown of an old, rich person surrounded with bags of money.]

Patrick: [points at the man's feet] This guy's got shoes!

Squidward: Give me that! [takes the magazine out of their hands] Stealing my mail, eh? You're lucky I don't report you to the authorities.

SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, how do the people in that magazine get all that money?

Squidward: They're entrepreneurs. They sell things to people.

SpongeBob: What kind of things?

Squidward: How should I know? Things people wanna buy. [walks off] Now keep your paws off my mail.

SpongeBob: That's it, Patrick! We gotta become entrepreneurs!

Patrick: Is that gonna hurt?

SpongeBob: Quick, Patrick, without thinking, if you could have anything in the world right now, what would it be?

Patrick: Uh... [sweats] More time for thinking.

SpongeBob: No, something real, an item, something you would pay for.

Patrick: [pops up behind him] A chocolate bar?

SpongeBob: That's a great idea, Pat! We'll become traveling chocolate bar salesmen!

[The scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick exiting the Barg'N-Mart carrying many chocolate bars.]

SpongeBob: Fancy living, here we come!

Patrick: Make way for a couple of ontre-prenyouers! [SpongeBob and Patrick walk up to a house]

SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, this is it! The first step on our road to living fancy! Just follow my lead.

[SpongeBob runs up and knocks on the door. Tom opens the door.]

SpongeBob: Good afternoon, sir, could we interest you in some [holds up chocolate bar] chocolate?

Tom: Chocolate? Did you say, chocolate?!

Patrick: Yes, sir. With or without nuts?

Tom: Chocolate?! CHOCOLATE?! CHOCOLATE! CHOCOLATE!

[SpongeBob and Patrick slowly back away, and then run off. Tom chases them while madly screaming "Chocolate!". The scene cuts to SpongeBob ringing the doorbell of another house.]

SpongeBob: Okay, the first guy didn't count. This is our real first step! [a con man opens the door] Good morning, sir! Would you like to buy some chocolate?

Con man: Chocolate bars, eh?

SpongeBob: Yes, sir, we are chocolate bar salesmen!

Con man: Ha! A couple of mediocre salesmen if you ask me. That's no way to carry your merchandise!

[Patrick is shown holding many chocolate bars in his pants.]

Con man: No, no no no, wrong. You guys wanna be good salesmen, right?

SpongeBob and Patrick: Oh, most certainly, sir!

Con man: Well, [chuckles] no self respecting candy bar salesman would be caught dead without one of these! [holds up a bright-orange bag]

SpongeBob: Wow... what is it?

Con man: It's a candy bar bag, you knucklehead! It's specially designed to cradle each candy bar in velvet-lined comfort!

[SpongeBob tries to touch it.]

Con man: [pulls the bag away] But, I'm wasting my time. [walks inside] You don't need these bags.

SpongeBob and Patrick: We need 'em! We need 'em!

[The con man grins, the scene changes to the Con man counting money. SpongeBob and Patrick are walking away with armfuls of bags.]

Con man: So long, boys! Happy hunting! [laughs when the two aren't looking] Suckers... [walks back inside]

SpongeBob and Patrick: [singing as they run off] Fancy livin', here we come! La la la la, la!

SpongeBob: Let's try next door!

[SpongeBob walks up and rings the doorbell with his foot, the same con man comes out.]

Con man: Yes?

SpongeBob: Huh? Say, weren't you the same guy who sold us these candy bar bags?

Con man: I... don't recall. But it looks to me like you fellas have got a lot of bags there. You two lady killers are too smart to be without one of my patented Candy Bar Bag Carrying Bags. [holds up two large maroon bags]

Patrick: We'll take twenty!

[Scene changes to SpongeBob knocking on the door of a different house. Sadie comes out.]

Sadie: Oh, what can I do for you two nice young men?

SpongeBob: We're selling chocolate bars. Would you like to buy one?

Sadie: That sounds heavenly! I'll take one.

SpongeBob: One chocolate bar, coming up!

[SpongeBob attempts to pull out a chocolate bar, but keeps pulling more bags, while Patrick is zipping and unzipping his pants.]

Sadie: [looks at her watch] I don't have time for this.

[Sadie goes back inside, and then SpongeBob pulls out a chocolate bar.]

SpongeBob: I... got it! One chocolate bar for the nice— [sees something off camera; it is revealed to be Tom, still screaming]

Tom: Chocolate! Chocolate! Chocolate!

SpongeBob: —lady. [Tom chases SpongeBob and Patrick again while screaming "Chocolate!". The scene cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick sitting in a diner] We're not doing so well, Patrick. We need a new approach, a new tactic.

Patrick: Hm... I got it! Let's get naked!

SpongeBob: No, let's save that for when we're selling real estate. There must be something. What was the reason we bought those bags?

Patrick: He said we were mediocre...

SpongeBob: That's it! He made us feel special!

Patrick: Yeah, he did... I'm going back to buy more bags!

[Patrick runs to the door.]

SpongeBob: No, wait, Patrick!

[Patrick freezes in place.]

SpongeBob: Why don't we try being nice?

Patrick: Oh, okay.

[Scene changes to SpongeBob and Patrick walking up to a customer's door.]

SpongeBob: Remember, Patrick, flatter the customer. Make him feel good.

[Patrick knocks on the door. A customer opens the door.]

Blue Fish with purple stripes: Hello?

Patrick: I love you.

[A harp is heard playing. The customer stares at SpongeBob and Patrick for a few seconds, then he slams his door shut in extreme disgust. A tuba is heard playing after the slamming.]

SpongeBob: I think you laid it on a teensy bit thick there, old pal. Let me try.

[SpongeBob rings the doorbell. The customer opens the door again.]

Blue Fish with purple stripes: Please. G-Go away!

SpongeBob: Um, [clears throat] H-H-How you doin'?

Blue Fish with purple stripes: How am I doing?

SpongeBob: Wanna buy some chocolate?

Patrick: We got him now!

Blue Fish with purple stripes: Sorry, chocolate has sugar and sugar turns to bubbling fat. Isn't that right, bubble boy?

[Patrick's belly is bubbling.]

Patrick: It tickles!

Blue Fish with purple stripes: As you can see, me and chocolate no longer hang.

[The customer holds up a picture of an obese self at age 13.]

Blue Fish with purple stripes: You can keep that for five bucks.

Patrick: I'll take ten!

[Cut to SpongeBob with a sad look on his face walking. A sad song plays.]

SpongeBob: We haven't sold one chocolate bar. I got a feeling that we're too easily distracted.

[Cut to Patrick staring at the pictures.]

Patrick: Huh?

[Far cut.]

SpongeBob: [raising his fist] Let's make a pact right now that we will stay focused on selling at the next house.

Patrick: [removing pictures from his face] Huh?

SpongeBob: [holding out his hand] Let's shake on it.

Patrick: [looking at SpongeBob confused] Did you say something?

[Cut to the other customer's house. SpongeBob and Patrick are seen entering the view.]

SpongeBob: Remember, Patrick, focus.

[Cut to the door. SpongeBob knocks on it. A customer answers.]

Purple Fish: Yes?

SpongeBob: Good afternoon, sir, we're selling chocolate bars.

[Patrick somehow moves up to the customer with his eyes going in and out back and forth.]

Purple Fish: Why is Chubby here staring at me?

[Cut to Patrick's eyes.]

Patrick: Focusing.

[Cut to the inside of the customer's house.]

Purple Fish: [freaks out] Back up, Jack!

[The customer slams the door on Patrick's eyes, Patrick is heard saying "Oof!" from the other side of the door.]

Patrick: [moving eyes around] Nice place you got in here.

[Bubbles come up and cut to the next scene. Patrick is eating a chocolate bar.]

SpongeBob: I can't understand what were doing wrong.

Patrick: I can't understand anything.

SpongeBob: There's something to this selling game that were just not getting. Other people do it, I mean look at that!

[Cut to the sign.]

Patrick: [reading the sign] Eat Barnacle Chips, they're delicious.

[Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick.]

SpongeBob: They are most certainly not delicious!

Patrick: [smiling] Not the way I use them!

[Cut to SpongeBob.]

SpongeBob: Yet they sell millions of bags a day!

[Cut to Patrick.]

Patrick: Well, maybe if they didn't stretch the truth, they wouldn't sell as many.

[Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick.]

SpongeBob: [Happily] That's it, Patrick! We've gotta stretch the truth!

Tom: Chocolate!

[SpongeBob and Patrick run off. Cut to Mary's house.]

SpongeBob: We'll work as a team. Let me get this customer warmed up, and then you come in for the kill!

Patrick: The kill!

[SpongeBob uses the doorbell. Mary answers.]

Mary: Yes?

[Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick.]

SpongeBob: Hello, young lady.

[SpongeBob winks at Patrick. Patrick then chuckles.]

SpongeBob: We're selling chocolate. [getting a closer look at Mary] Is your mother home?

[Cut to Mary.]

Mary: Mom!

Mary's mother: [entering from the right side of the house] What, what, what's all the yelling?

[Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick who have stunned looks on their faces. Cut back to Mary's mother.]

Mary's mother: You just can't wait for me to die, can you?

[Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick.]

Mary: They're selling chocolate.

Mary's mother: Chocolate?

Mary: Yeah!

[Cut to Mary and her mom.]

Mary's mother: What, what are they selling?

Mary: Chocolates!

Mary's mother: What?

Mary: Chocolates!

Mary's mother: I can't hear you!

Mary: They're selling chocolates!

Mary's mother: They're selling chocolate?

Mary: Yeah!

[Cut to a close-up of Mary's mother smiling.]

Mary's mother: Chocolate. I remember when they first invented chocolate. Sweet, sweet chocolate.

[Cut back to view Mary and her mom.]

Mary's mother: I always hated it!

[Cut to SpongeBob sweating.]

SpongeBob: Oh, but this chocolate's not for eating. It's for...

[Patrick comes from the top left.]

Patrick: You rub it on your skin and it makes you live forever.

[Cut to Mary and her mom, Mary is heard saying no constantly.]

Mary's mother: Live forever, you say? I'll take one. [Mary slaps her face. Cut to the outside, Mary pays SpongeBob a dollar.]

Mary's mother: [From inside house] Come on, you lazy Mary! [cut to Mary] Start rubbing me with that chocolate!

Mary: [looking at SpongeBob and Patrick angrily] I hate you. [slams door. Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick]

SpongeBob: If we keep exaggerating the truth, we'll be fancy living in no time!

Patrick: [raising fist] Hooray for lying!

[Bubbles transition to SpongeBob and Patrick. Patrick is seen with a look that was about to make him laugh.]

SpongeBob: It'll make your hair grow.

[Cut to Fred.]

Fred: Great! My wife's trying to grow a beard!

[Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick. Patrick has a sad face this time.]

SpongeBob: They'll make you sound smart.

[Cut to the customer holding money.]

Customer: [southern accent] I'll take twenty!

[Cut to Patrick.]

Patrick: It'll keep your face from getting any uglier.

[Cut to the two Patricks.]

Patrick 2: Just in time.

[Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick over and over.]

SpongeBob: They'll make you fly!

Patrick: You'll fall in love!

SpongeBob: They'll bring world peace!

Patrick: You'll walk through walls!

SpongeBob: [echoing] You'll rule the world!

[Cut to a door. SpongeBob and Patrick are wrapped in casts. Cut close to Patrick.]

Patrick: This'll be the best lie yet!

[Cut to SpongeBob.]

SpongeBob: Yeah, this guy will feel so sorry for us, he'll have to buy all of our chocolate!

[A customer opens the door.]

Customer: What can I do for you boys?

[Cut to SpongeBob.]

SpongeBob: Hello, sir. Would you like to buy a chocolate bar? We need an operation.

Customer: Really?

[Cut to the customer, who apparently is in a cast covering his entire body.]

Customer: Small world. What's the matter with you guys?

[Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick, who are completely stunned.]

SpongeBob: [nervously] Um, we've got some head trauma and internal bleeding.

[Cut to the customer.]

Customer: Ah, some guys have all the luck.

[A violin begins.]

Customer: I was born with glass bones and paper skin. Every morning, I break my legs, and every afternoon, I break my arms.

[Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick. They both have faces meaning that they are about to cry.]

Customer: At night, [as SpongeBob looks up sadly, a tear runs down his face] I lie awake in agony until my heart attacks put me to sleep.

[Cut to the customer, the wires snap.]

Customer: [about to fall] Oh, no...

[A glass breaking sound is heard while the customer grunts while hitting the steps.]

Customer: [on the last step] Ow...

[Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick.]

SpongeBob: Quick, Patrick, let's help him!

[Cut to the inside of the house. SpongeBob and Patrick enter from the left.]

SpongeBob: Careful, put him down gently.

[Patrick drops the customer's head. A glass breaking sound is heard. Cut close to the customer.]

Customer: [in pain] Ow...!

[Cut to SpongeBob.]

SpongeBob: Poor, poor man. If there's anything, anything we can do to help you?

[Cut to the customer.]

Customer: Well, there is one thing... as you can well imagine, my medical bills are extremely high, but luckily, I am able to keep myself alive by selling... chocolate bars. [gestures his head over to a massive stack of chocolate bar boxes. Bubbles come up and cut to the next scene. Cut to the customer looking out his window as SpongeBob and Patrick walk by]

Customer: Such nice boys, [far cut to the customer] it does my heart good to con a couple of Class A suckeroonies like those two! Ha ha ha!

[Cut to a close-up of the customer laughing while looking at his cash, zipping his costume off to reveal himself as the con artist from earlier. Cut to the street.]

SpongeBob: [grunting] Don't get me wrong, Patrick. It's great that we helped that guy out, but there's no one left in town to sell chocolate bars to.

[SpongeBob makes another grunting noise, he trips up on a rock and falls, cut to SpongeBob with a box flat on his face.]

SpongeBob: Let's admit it, Patrick. We're failures.

Patrick: [walking in from the left] I can live with that. [places box on SpongeBob's box and sits on it, making a small squeaking sound]

SpongeBob: Let's change our names to "Why" and "Bother".

[Tom appears behind the box.]

Tom: [screams] Chocolate! [knocks SpongeBob, Patrick and the boxes over. Cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick, who hug while scared]

SpongeBob: [simultaneously with Patrick] No! Don't hurt us. Please don't hurt me. No no. Please...

Patrick: [simultaneously with SpongeBob] No! Have mercy on me! Please spare me!

[Cuts to Tom laughing manically.]

Tom: Finally! I've been trying to catch you boys all day! Now that I got you right where I want you... [turns back to normal] I'd like to buy all your chocolate. [holds up a large amount of cash. Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick looking shocked. Chocolate bars fall out of Patrick's shorts, along with a Hershey's kiss. Cut back to the three. SpongeBob and Patrick melt]

SpongeBob: Thank you for your patronage.

[Bubbles come up and cut to the next scene. Patrick is pushing a wheelbarrow which is full of money.]

Patrick: Are we living the fancy life yet, SpongeBob?

[Cut to the money in the barrel, SpongeBob pops out.]

SpongeBob: Not yet, pally! First, we got to spend all the money.

[Cut to the two.]

Patrick: But what are we going to spend it on?

[Cut to SpongeBob thinking. Bubbles come up and cut to the next scene. A boat in a bottle with "Fancy!" on top is seen. Cut to the inside of the boat.]

Squidward: [walking in from the left] Good evening, sir. Table for one, please.

Server: Sorry, but the whole restaurant has been rented to a private party.

[Cut to Squidward shocked.]

Squidward: But it's my only night to be fancy! Oh, who could afford to rent out the whole restaurant?

Server: Oh, a couple of rich entrepreneurs, [leaning over to Squidward] and their dates.

[Cut to SpongeBob, Patrick, Mary, and Mary's mother. Mary is seen holding a glass.]

SpongeBob: So, how long have you two ladies known each other?

[Pause.]

Mary's mother: What? What did he say?

Squidward: There's my hat... and there's that, and here we go. [starts riding his bicycle to work and passes a tall piece of stalk with a treehouse on top of it with SpongeBob and Patrick in it]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [giggling]
SpongeBob: Wey, wook. It's Widward!
Squidward: What?
SpongeBob and Patrick: [laughs]
SpongeBob: Widward's woing to work.
SpongeBob and Patrick: [laughs]
Squidward: [growls]
Patrick: Where does he work? Wat the Wusty Wab?
SpongeBob and Patrick: [laughs]
Squidward: What's that supposed to be— some kind of stupid secret code?
SpongeBob: We can't tell you 'cause you're not a member of the club.
Squidward: Oh, yeah? What does it take to be a member, besides being a moron? [laughs] Moron... [laughs again] as a requirement. [laughs again]
SpongeBob: Sorry, Squidward, but you couldn't get in even if you tried!
Squidward: Huh? Well, I'll have you know that I am a member of over 20 different exclusive clubs all across the sea bottom!
Patrick: [whispering to SpongeBob] What did he say?
SpongeBob: [whispering to Patrick] I don't know. Something about his nose?
Patrick: [sticks his head out of the "Clubhouse" and talks to Squidward] Squidward, you and your nose will definitely NOT fit in.
Squidward: Oh, what do you two zeros know about fitting in? [takes off his hat and starts to climb up the "Clubhouse"] Why, you should be begging me to join!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Squidward! Squidward, no, no, no! Stop! No, no, no, stop, please, please! Stop, Squidward! You can't join! You can't join! Can't join! You can't get in!
[Squidward grunts as he tries to get in the "Clubhouse"]
Squidward: Well, this is stupid. There's no room up here!
Patrick: That's what we've been trying to tell you!
SpongeBob: We've been stuck up here for three days.
Patrick: We told you you wouldn't fit in.
Squidward: [sneers]
SpongeBob: Well, since you're here, Squidward, we'll give you the new member initiation. Are you ready, Patrick?
Patrick: Ready!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [singing] Welcome to our club! Welcome to our club! Welcome Squidward! Welcome Squidward! Welcome Squidward! Welcome Squidward! Welcome Squid...!
Squidward: SHUT YOUR HALF-WIT PIEHOLES!!! [grabs a stalk beside the one holding up the "Clubhouse" and pulls it while the other one is going down] I do not now, nor will I ever, want to be a member of your stupid club! [gets to the floor but the stalk snaps and the stalk holding up the "Clubhouse" flings back very fast and the "Clubhouse" flies off it. He starts screaming]
Nancy: Whoa!
Frank: Make a wish, honey.
[Squidward continues screaming. The "Clubhouse" falls into the Kelp Forest]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Again! Oh, yeah! Again! [they victory screech]
Squidward: Oh, no. That didn't just happen. Please tell me that didn't happen!
Patrick: What happened?
[SpongeBob shrugs. Squidward runs around the "Clubhouse"]
Squidward: Where are we? We're lost! There's no way out! Stuck... in the middle of nowhere... with SpongeBob and Patrick!
[SpongeBob and Patrick wave at Squidward who starts crying]
Squidward: Oh, why must every 11 minutes of my life be filled with misery?!?! WHY-Y-Y-Y?!
SpongeBob: Cheer up, Squidward, it could be worse.
Patrick: Yeah, you could be bald and have a big nose.
[camera zooms in on Squidward's head which deflates]
Squidward: Well... this is the end. [head falls on the ground]
SpongeBob: No it's not, Squidward!
Patrick: [building coffins] It's not?
SpongeBob: Come on, guys, we're gonna be fine! [patting Squidward's head] As long as we stick together. Remember, we're a club!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [they do the victory screech again]
SpongeBob: And besides, we have this! [pulls out a conch shell]
Squidward: What's that?
Patrick: Ohhh! The Magic Conch Shell! Ask it something! Ask it something!
SpongeBob: Magic Conch Shell, will I ever get married? [pulls the string attached to the Magic Conch]
Magic Conch: Maybe someday.
SpongeBob and Patrick: [giggling] Oooohhhh!
Squidward: You've got to be kidding! That is just a stupid toy! How can that possibly help us?
SpongeBob: [gasps] Squidward, we must never question the wisdom of the Magic Conch. The club always takes its advice before we do anything.
Patrick: The shell knows all!
SpongeBob: Oh, Magic Conch Shell. What do we need to do to get out of the Kelp Forest?
Magic Conch: Nothing.
Patrick: The shell has spoken!
Squidward: Nothing?! We can't just sit here and do nothing!
[SpongeBob and Patrick are sitting down doing nothing]
Squidward: [growls] I can't believe you two are gonna take advice from a toy!
[SpongeBob and Patrick still do nothing]
Squidward: [growls again] All right, all right, all right! I don't need your help. I'm gonna find my way back to sanity! [starts walking away in the Kelp Forest] But don't you two sad clowns come crying to me when your circus tent comes crashing down! Sad clowns... [laughs] sad... [laughs again] clowns. [laughs again. Later, he began to run fast and grew scared and started panting rapidly] What was that? I was already here! Which way do I go? Oh, I'm lost! [trips and falls] Ohh... I'm hopelessly lost! I'll never get out of here! [sees light] Huh? Hhahahahahahaahhaa!! [he goes toward the light] I'm FREE!! Take that SpongeBob and Patrick!! Ahahaha!! Ahahaha!! [pumps fists in the air triumphantly but sees SpongeBob and Patrick; falls on the ground] Ohhh, there's no way out of here... [scene cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick still doing nothing. A stick is thrown at Patrick's head. Squidward is putting a pan over a fire] How's it going over there at Club Shell-for-Brains? Mmm-mmm-mmm. I am hungry. I wonder what's on the menu for Club Squidward tonight? [spots a bug running around so he steps on it] Ah... [puts the bug on the pan and walks over to SpongeBob and waves the pan over his nose] Doesn't that smell good, SpongeBob? You haven't eaten in days. [walks over to Patrick] How about you, Patrick? A big boy's gotta eat. Well, you can't have any. [walks away from Patrick] And do you know why, SpongeBob? Because your club president is a shell! [shakes his butt in SpongeBob's face] If you had listened to me you'd have food, shelter, and a roaring fire. But instead you listened to a talking clam... [moves back to Club Squidward] that tells you nothing. [stirs the pan] As if the answers to all your problems will fall right out of the sky. Hahaha, fall right out of the sky! [camera switches to an airplane falling out of the sky]
Scooter: DUDE! We're falling right out of the sky! We gotta drop the load! [presses the "Drop the Load" button. The airplane drops picnic supplies to where SpongeBob and Patrick are]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Praise the Magic Conch! [victory screech. Squidward stares shockingly. The bug gets up, hits him with the stick, and runs off. SpongeBob and Patrick eat. SpongeBob eats two hamburgers. Patrick eating a whole turkey in one bite. Now, when SpongeBob and Patrick are drinking, SpongeBob is drinking a can of soda and Patrick is drinking a bottle of ketchup. They laugh and Squidward goes to them]
Squidward: Uh, hey, uh, SpongeBob... that sure is a lot of food you got there.
SpongeBob: It's a gift from the Magic Conch.
Squidward: Everything sure looks delicious. [gasps] Oh! Smoked sausages! My favorite! [smells them but Patrick sucks them in and Squidward's nose too. He pulls his nose out] Uh, hey, uh, [laughs] SpongeBob, I...you know I was just kidding around earlier and-and-and I-I-I mean I'm... I'm still part of the club, right? And... and-and-and-and-and after all, the-the club's gotta stick together, and I-I mean... you know, I-I, um... [stammers] [While he is saying all this, SpongeBob is eating a cookie and is drinking a glass of orange juice]
SpongeBob: Squidward?
Squidward: Umm...uh..yeah?
SpongeBob: Once a member, always a member!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [clink glasses] To the club! [victory screech]
Squidward: Yeah. [mimics the victory screech, weakly] Now, uh, if you'll excuse me... [runs to the table with all the food] All right... what shall I eat first? The spaghetti, the turkey, the soup, the canned meat?
SpongeBob: Why don't you ask... the magic conch, Squidward?
Squidward: Oh, yeah, like that'll happen. Right after I consult the Magic Toenail.
[Squidward prepares to eat but SpongeBob and Patrick pull the table away and block it]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Squidward, are you questioning the authority of the Magic Conch? The conch is the one who gave us this banquet. This copyrighted conch is the cornerstone of our organization.
Patrick: [whispering] Maybe he's not a brother.
[SpongeBob looks at Squidward wide-eyed]
Squidward: [chuckles] Hey, y-you guys have it all wrong. I-I love this, uh, piece of plastic. [takes the Magic Conch from SpongeBob] Uh, hello there. Magic Conch, uh, I was wondering... uh, should I have the spaghetti or the turkey?
Magic Conch: Neither.
Squidward: Oh. Then how about the soup?
Magic Conch: I don't think so.
Squidward: [becomes annoyed] Could I have anything to eat?
Magic Conch: No.
Squidward: No?! What do you mean no? I'm starving here!
Patrick: [takes Magic Conch] Here, let me try. Magic Conch, could Squidward have some of this yummy, delicious, super-terrific sandwich?
Magic Conch: No.
Patrick: Hmm... [happily] Could I have this yummy, delicious, super-terrific sandwich?
Magic Conch: Yes.
Patrick: All right! [vacuums in the sandwich and burps] Sorry, Squidward.
Squidward: Give me that! [takes Magic Conch] Could I have something to eat?
Magic Conch: No.
Squidward: Could I have something to eat?
Magic Conch: No.
Squidward: Could I have something to eat!?
Magic Conch: No.
Squidward: Can't you say anything else but no?!
Magic Conch: Try asking again.
Squidward: [asks excitedly with a grin on his face] Can I have something to eat?
Magic Conch: [in a very insulting, sarcastic-like tone] No!
[Squidward starts getting enraged.]
SpongeBob: Squidward, are you all right?
[Squidward shakes his head uncontrollably.]
Patrick: Maybe we should ask the shell if he's okay.
Kelp Forest Ranger: [offscreen] Hello? Anyone there? Hello? HELLO?! [he reveals himself after he cuts through the kelp. He gasps and sees SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward dirty] Do you folks need some help?
Squidward: [gasps] I'm saved! [runs over to the forest ranger] You don't know how happy I am to see you. I have been stranded out here for weeks with-with-with these two barnacle heads and their Magic Conch Shell!
Kelp Forest Ranger: Magic... Conch... Shell? [pulls out a Magic Conch Shell] You mean like this?!? [says this while cross-eyed and having two big teeth]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [they jump but they stop in midair] The Magic Conch! A club member!
Kelp Forest Ranger: [victory screech]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [victory screech]
Squidward: [dumbstruck] Uhhbuuuhhh...
Kelp Forest Ranger: My conch told me to come save you guys.
SpongeBob, Patrick and Kelp Forest Ranger: Hooray for the magic conches!
Kelp Forest Ranger: [we see Squidward in the background looking unhappy] All right, Magic Conch. What do we do now?
Magic Conch: Nothing.
SpongeBob, Patrick, and Kelp Forest Ranger: All hail the Magic Conch! [they sit down doing nothing. Squidward, still dumbstruck, moves in between them]
Squidward: All hail the magic conch! [sits down with SpongeBob, Patrick, and the Kelp Forest Ranger]

SpongeBob: [runs outside to retrieve the newspaper] Gary, the paper's here! [Gary comes out on a motorized skateboard. SpongeBob gives him the paper but keeps the rubber band.] You can have this, buddy. 'Cause all I need is the entertainment section! [shakes the rubber band around for emphasis. Hums while he stretches the rubber band around the middle of his body and snaps it together, turning him into a bowtie-like shape] I am a happy sponge! [runs around, laughing, while Gary is reading the paper]
Gary: [looking slightly annoyed by SpongeBob by rolling his eyes] Meow! [SpongeBob runs into Patrick, who also has a rubber band stretched around him]
Patrick: I see you got the paper. [his rubber band snaps off]
SpongeBob: Oh, hey, Patrick. [then his rubber band snaps off as well. Patrick clears his throat] Well, I'd better get going.
Patrick: Yep, see you later. [both walk off but then hear a chirping sound and they both quickly run back, with their hands over their ears]
SpongeBob and Patrick: What did you say?
Patrick: Well, I didn't say anything.
SpongeBob: I didn't say anything, either.
SpongeBob and Patrick: See you later then. [both walk off again and the squeaking noise is heard again, so they both run back. This time, they are angry]
SpongeBob: [Pointing at Patrick] Alright, quit messing with me! I know you said something.
Patrick: Ah, but it is you [points] that is messing with me. [both look down to see the squeaking noise is coming from a shaking branch. Patrick points downward.] That's what's messing with us!
SpongeBob: It's a baby scallop.
Patrick: [lifts up his foot with a threatening look on his face, looking as though he is about to smash the scallop] I'll take care of this!
SpongeBob: No, Patrick! It's totally helpless. [takes the baby scallop in his hands] It looks like he can't even fly yet.
Patrick: What's the matter, is he stupid?
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, he's just a baby. [close-up of the chirping scallop in SpongeBob's hands] He's all alone with no one to take care of him.
Patrick: Well, we can't just leave him out here.
SpongeBob: You're right. Come on, let's take him into the pineapple. [both run in and set the baby scallop on the ground] Hmmm, let's see, we need a box for him to sleep in. [SpongeBob removes his pants and sets it in front of the scallop] There you go. It's the best seat [points to his rear] in the house. [scene cuts to Gary, who does a rimshot]
Patrick: Let me see! [Patrick sticks his whole head inside SpongeBob's pants] Hey, he's kinda cute. Uh-oh! [takes his head out, which is now eaten on the side] I think somebody's hungry!
SpongeBob: [takes out Junior and speaks in baby-talk to it] Is it true? Are you hungry?
Junior: [chirping happily] Cheep-cheep-cheep-cheep!
SpongeBob: I've got just the thing. [puts Junior on a barrel and takes out a Krabby Patty] How would you like a Krabby Patty? [Junior yelps]
Patrick: SpongeBob SquarePants, are you crazy? That's not the right food for a little fella like him!
SpongeBob: Of course not. I don't know what I was thinking. What he needs is a tiny Krabby Patty. [shows Junior a minuscule Krabby Patty]
Junior: [sniffs the patty, then sticks his tongue out in disgust] Blech!
SpongeBob: Huh? No one's ever turned down one of these before. [gobbles it and gulps it down]
Patrick: [holds up a doughnut] Let's try a doughnut. [Junior hisses]
SpongeBob: [holds up a tray of French fries] French fries?
Junior: [shaking his head] Unh-unh.
Patrick: [eating the doughnut] A doughnut? [Junior blows a raspberry]
SpongeBob: [holds up an apple] All we have left is this apple. [a worm pokes its head out of the apple]
Worm: Hello, sea creatures! I bring you greetings from Apple World! [Junior chirps in excitement]
SpongeBob: Of course! Scallops love worms. [picks up the worm]
Worm: Huh, wait! We will bury you! [SpongeBob drops it in Junior's mouth]
SpongeBob: Well, you should be good for the rest of the... [Junior cries]
Patrick: What now?
SpongeBob: I don't know! Aww, don't cry. [Junior is still crying]
Patrick: Do something, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Uhh...uhh...uhh... Blah-blah-blah! Look at the funny face! Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo! Look at the funny face! [shows SpongeBob has a puppet that looks like him on his hand] Look at the funny face!
Patrick: Wait! I think I might know the problem. [picks up Junior and looks at him] Yep, that's it, alright. [hides it behind his back] Hold on just one second. There he is, good as new. [Junior has a diaper on]
SpongeBob: How did you know?
Patrick: How do you think? [drops his pants showing that he is wearing a diaper] And I've been doing it all by myself for almost a year.
SpongeBob: Wow, I'm sure glad you're here.
Patrick: I know, good thing there's two of us.
SpongeBob: You know, Patrick, since this scallop doesn't have parents, we should raise it ourselves.
Patrick: Yeah. At least until it's old enough to be on its own. Oh, I wanna be the mom!
SpongeBob: I don't think you can be the mom, Patrick, because you never wear a shirt.
Patrick: You're right. If I was a mom..., [the camera draws back to reveal Patrick's hairy, obese, unsightly form]...this would be kind of shocking. [lifts his arms, revealing armpit hair] Just call me Daddy!
Montage:
Patrick: [softly, from inside the house] It sure is cute when it's asleep.
SpongeBob: [softly, from inside the house] Yeah. [SpongeBob and Patrick watch Junior sleeping] Shh! [both tiptoe out of the room]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob? [goes to what appears to be the right side of the bed]
SpongeBob: [goes to what appears to be the left side] Yes, Patrick?
Patrick: I never thought being a parent could be this much fun.
SpongeBob: Me neither.
[scene zooms out, revealing that Patrick is sleeping on the bottom mattress and SpongeBob is sleeping on the top]
Patrick: Well, good night, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Good night, Patrick. [SpongeBob's mattress slams shut on top of Patrick. Scene cuts to morning] Patrick, breakfast is ready. [SpongeBob is cooking something over at the grill as Patrick walks in, noticing the bunch of food that is on the table]
Patrick: Alright! All this parenting stuff makes me hungry. [lifts the table up as all the food slides down into mouth. He burps, then pats Junior] Hey, Junior, how are you doing today? [smells an odor from Junior] SpongeBob? [adjusts his tie]
SpongeBob: Yes, Patrick?
Patrick: Kid's got a stinky.
SpongeBob: [doing many chores at the same time] Can you take care of him? My hands are kind of full. [Patrick guzzles down the coffee as Junior begins to cry]
Patrick: [drinking coffee] Ahh. Wish I could, but I gotta get going.
SpongeBob: Going? Where are you going?
Patrick: [puts on a suit and takes his briefcase] I'm goin' to work. I'm the dad, remember?
SpongeBob: You mean I have to do all this baby stuff myself?
Patrick: I'll give you a break tonight when I get home. Don't you two stop being adorable. [chuckles as he closes the door]
SpongeBob: Okay. [chuckles weakly. Day turns into night, and Patrick walks in and takes his jacket and hat off]
Patrick: Phew! What a day.
SpongeBob: Oh, great, you're home. Now you can help me with the baby.
Patrick: Aw, gee, SpongeBob, I'd love to, but I'm totally beat from work.
SpongeBob: Huh? [Patrick sits down and watches TV. A coconut "clonk" sound effect is heard.]
Patrick: [laughs] That guy got hit in the head with a coconut!
SpongeBob: [walks in still doing the chores] Patrick, what about my break?
Patrick: Oh yeah, your break. Uh, tomorrow, I promise.
SpongeBob: Uhh, okay, tomorrow.
Narrator: Tomorrow... [scene cuts to Patrick walking in at night and taking his stuff off]
Patrick: Phew! Another tough day. [walks by SpongeBob, who is still doing the same chores from yesterday]
SpongeBob: Oh, Patrick, I'm so glad you're home after working all day. I can't wait for my break.
Patrick: Work was a killer. I need my chair. [sits down and watches TV again]
SpongeBob: [walks in still doing chores] Patrick, I really need my...
Patrick: Tomorrow for sure.
Narrator: Tomorrow for sure... [scene cuts to a tired SpongeBob doing the same chores as Patrick walks by]
SpongeBob: Patrick?
Patrick: I'll get to it eventually...
Narrator: Eventually... [scene cuts to SpongeBob still doing the chores but even more tired]
SpongeBob: Uhhh?
Patrick: Uhhh.
Narrator: Uhhh... [scene cuts to Patrick watching TV as an angry SpongeBob walks in and turns on the lights]
SpongeBob: Patrick Star, we need to talk.
Patrick: Just one more minute, I gotta...
SpongeBob: Don't 'one more minute' me, Mr. Man! [turns off the TV]
Patrick: Hey, I'm missin' the coconut! [he gives SpongeBob an angry look]
SpongeBob: You haven't been helping at all with Junior! [pulls in baby stroller] We made a commitment and you're not doing your share! You never do anything.
Patrick: I changed his diaper!
SpongeBob: Yeah, once.
Patrick: He's only this big. [shows with his hands on how big Junior is] How many diapers could he possibly use?
SpongeBob: [opens up a trash can full of diapers] Hmmm?
Patrick: Oh, that's not so much.
SpongeBob: [points over to the corner of the room where there are two bags and a trash can full of diapers] Hmmm?
Patrick: [nervously] So?
SpongeBob: [opens up the refrigerator, full of diapers] Hmmm? [pulls the cover off the couch, revealing it to be diapers] Hmmm? [tears the wallpaper off the wall, revealing a bunch of diapers behind it] Hmmm?! [points outside to a garbage truck loading a bunch of diapers into the dumpster. Patrick quivers at the sight of it]
Patrick: [his eyes fill with tears] I have no idea! What kind of a father am I?! Oh! [sobs as he looks at SpongeBob as he smiles] I'll make it up to you, buddy. I promise. [scene cuts to next day]
SpongeBob: So, what's the plan for the day?
Patrick: No more foolin' around. From now on, I'm Super-Dad! I'll work straight through lunch so I can get home on time. So make sure you save a big ol' stinky diaper for me to change, and you can take the night off, pal.
SpongeBob: [gives Patrick his briefcase as he departs] Great, so I'll see you at six o'clock.
Patrick: Six o'clock.
SpongeBob: Six o'clock.
Patrick: Six o'clock.
SpongeBob: [waving] Six o'clock.
Patrick: [waving] Six o'clock.
SpongeBob: Six o'clock.
Patrick: Six o'clock. [cuts to a time card]
Narrator: 12:00 midnight.
[Patrick walks in with a lampshade over his head, giggling and turns on the light]
Patrick: Oh, that was some party! [SpongeBob is wearing his mother-like clothing and he gives Patrick a bitter look] Oh, hey, SpongeBob. Hey, Junior. [SpongeBob now looks at Patrick angrily as he taps his foot] What? What?!
SpongeBob: Oh, nothing.
Patrick: Oh, what a relief. [takes the lampshade off his head and puts it on SpongeBob] For a second there, I thought you were mad at me.
SpongeBob: [takes the lampshade off his head] Do you remember what you said to me this morning?
Patrick: Somethin' about root beer, right?
SpongeBob: [takes a deep breath, flatly] No.
Patrick: Oh, wait, wait, let me guess. I give up.
SpongeBob: Does... [imitates Patrick in a mocking tone with a goofy look on his face] "You can take the night off, pal!" [normal voice] ...ring a bell?
Patrick: [raspberry] I don't need this. [walks outside]
SpongeBob: What?! [walks to the door] Where do you think you're going?
Patrick: [opens his rock] I'm going back to work! [gets in and closes his rock]
SpongeBob: Work?! [growls and rips off his hairpiece]
[Cut to SpongeBob, not wearing his mother-like clothing anymore, walking outside to Patrick's rock. He opens it up, and finds Patrick in his easy chair, watching TV]
Patrick: [two "clonk" sounds are heard on the TV; laughs] He got hit in the head with two coconuts!
SpongeBob: [angrily] So, this is work?
Patrick: You know, it's not as easy as it looks. Sometimes, I gotta move the antenna, sometimes, I lose the remote, [looks at his rear] and sometimes, my butt itches real bad!
SpongeBob: [sarcastically] Oh, you poor, poor thing. By the way, you forgot your briefcase! [he pulls a briefcase out from behind his back, and opens it up to reveal that it is filled with donuts and ice cream sundaes as he angrily dumps it all over Patrick]
Patrick: [quietly but furiously] Oh, so this is the thanks I get for working overtime?
[SpongeBob is enraged. He balls his fists and fumes so hard, his entire body shakes. Then he loses his temper and goes ballistic on Patrick, and his face morphs into a stereotypical Asian face with lots of teeth.]
SpongeBob: [Screaming intensely] OVERTIME?!
[SpongeBob jumps into Patrick's rock, and they both begin to argue intensely.]
Patrick: Yeah, overtime, pal!
SpongeBob: [overlapping Patrick] Oh, boy, yeah, you're working!
Patrick: You know what that means?
SpongeBob: And that's the kind of work you're doing?
Patrick: ​It means working when you're just too tired to work!
SpongeBob: Show me where I can sign up for this, because I've been working my fingers to the bone!
[Junior is heard beginning to chirp]
Patrick: You just keep going on working and working!
SpongeBob: ​You never help! NEVER!
[Junior's chirping intensifies, which makes the two finally stop arguing and listen to it]
Patrick: [still mad] There's that stupid noise again!
SpongeBob: Oh, that's not a stupid noise. That's just Junior about to jump out of that two-story window.
[Patrick and SpongeBob see Junior teetering on the edge of the window of SpongeBob's house, ready to fly.]
Patrick: [calmly] Oh.
[All at once, Patrick and SpongeBob are struck with shock by what's really happening.]
Both: [eyes bulge in horror, screaming] JUNIOR!
[Junior jumps down the window. SpongeBob and Patrick quickly run to catch Junior but they slam on SpongeBob's house. SpongeBob then bounces out of Patrick's stomach]
SpongeBob: [Frantic] Did you catch him?!
Patrick: [looking sadly at his empty hands] No.
Both: We're bad parents! [They break down sobbing. Then they stop when they notice that chirping Junior is flying above them.]
SpongeBob: Junior? He's flying!
Patrick: I guess he's all grown up. [Junior kisses SpongeBob then flies off] Hey, what about Daddy? [Junior drops a coconut on Patrick's head for his laziness then kisses him] That's my boy.
SpongeBob: Goodbye!
Patrick: [the coconut falls down] Goodbye, Junior!
[they watch Junior fly away]
SpongeBob: Well, Patrick, he doesn't need us anymore.
Patrick: This is the hardest part of every parent's life, I assume.
SpongeBob: Despite all we've been through, it was worth it.
Patrick: Yeah... Let's have another.
[SpongeBob looks shocked]

[Mrs. Puff is panicking while SpongeBob is in his driving test again and destroying stuff, as usual.]
SpongeBob: I'm driving, Mrs. Puff! This is the one! This is the one! Come, on SpongeBob! Think! Think! Uhh... [destroys the lighthouse] Turn that way! Turn that way! D'oh! Turn that way! Right! Left! Oh no! No! [destroys the school building] Come on, don't ever do that! Come on! [a nuclear explosion is heard and a mushroom cloud appears] No! I'm ready! I can do this, Mrs. Puff! I can do it! I can do it! [flies through the entrance while driving, constantly destroying it, leading the fences falling down]
Mrs. Puff: The driving test is over, SpongeBob. Stop the boat!
SpongeBob: Wait, I can do this, Mrs. Puff, I can do this!
Mrs. Puff: The road, SpongeBob, get back on the road!
SpongeBob: Gotta pass the test! Gotta pass! [Mrs. Puff is screaming as the boat goes through a cart of watermelons]
Vendor: Hey! What've you got against the melons?!
Mrs. Puff: Look out!
SpongeBob: [has a watermelon on his face] This must be the night driving part of the test. [scene cuts to two police officers using their nightsticks on something offscreen]
Officer Nancy: We're gonna straighten you out!
Officer Malley: This'll fix ya! [They grunt as they hit a parking meter until it's straight] Now let's get that one. [points his nightstick at another crooked parking meter. SpongeBob & Mrs. Puff drive by through a building, knocking it over]
Officer Nancy: Barnacles, did you see that?!
Officer Malley: Yeah! That guy had no front license plate! Let's get him! [SpongeBob looks back at the numerous police cars chasing behind him]
SpongeBob: Hey, look at all those police! I wonder if the president's in town.
Mrs. Puff: Look out! [The mayor is cutting a ribbon at the end of a bridge that is not finished]
Mayor: It is with great pride that I officially open this unfinished bridge! [SpongeBob drives through the ribbon before he cuts it. The crowd of people that are gathering around the mayor take pictures. SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff do not make it on the other side of the bridge so they fall to the bottom.]
Mrs. Puff: Where did I go wrong?! [flashback to Mrs. Puff's first day of boating school] With the opening of my new boating school, I pledge that as long as a student is willing to learn, I shall never give up. [SpongeBob walks up to her]
SpongeBob: Hi, I'm SpongeBob SquarePants. [scene cuts back to Mrs. Puff, who is still screaming. Scene then shows a retirement home where a fish in a white coat is yelling at a truck]
Fish: Hurry up with that truckload of fruit punch! The seniors are getting cranky! [fish looks up and notices SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff crashing into the truck]
Mrs. Puff: Alive! I'm alive! Oh, thank Neptune, I'm still... [a squad car smashes down on the boat mobile. The other squad cars fall on and around the truck. The truck falls over on its side as all the fruit punch comes pouring out]
Feminine Tom: [inside the retirement home] Alright, seniors, let's open these windows so the world can see your nice white clothes. [when the window is opened, the fruit punch pours in. Scene cuts to Fred, who is mopping the hallway and listening to "Surfin' Summer" by the Beach Boys on his headphones. The fruit punch fills the hallway, drains, and Fred is still mopping the same spot. Scene cut to an elderly fish man, who is writing on some paper]
Elderly Fish: Oh, it's finally finished! A memoir of my life, written in red ink. [red punch comes flowing in, making his memoir papers soggy and red] Aww, barnacles! [scene cuts back to outside where all the mess is]
Mrs. Puff: Ow. SpongeBob, are you okay?
SpongeBob: That depends, did I pass?
Officer Nancy: Freeze, you're under arrest!
Mrs. Puff: Hold it, you can't arrest him! He's just a student driver!
Officer Nancy: We're not talking about him. [scene cuts to Mrs. Puff wearing a prison uniform, being locked up in jail]
Mrs. Puff: But I don't belong here! It's all a big mistake!
Prisoner 1: Yeah, I don't belong here, either!
Prisoner 2: Me too! I'm innocent!
Prisoner 3: [yelling in a butch Southern drawl] I belong here! [this triggers some other prisoners to complain about their not belonging here too. Puff walks over and sits down on the bed]
Mrs. Puff: Okay, you can do this, Puff. You can get through this without losing your sanity. Oh, that's a road we don't want to go down again. Positives. Think of the positives. Let's see... I've got no more papers to grade. Yeah! [laughs then jumps to the floor] In fact, no more work. No more boating school classes. No more driving, no more SpongeBob... [Mrs. Puff's brain clicks and a sonar ping is heard] No more phone solicitors, no more SpongeBob! No more company potlucks, no more SpongeBob! [gets into bed] No more road rage, no more SpongeBob! No more insurance payments, no more SpongeBob! No more SpongeBob! [laughing] No more SpongeBob! [screaming maniacally] No more SpongeBob! [sighs] I think I'm going to like this place. [scene cuts to her boating school, which is deserted and dusty, with SpongeBob the only one in the room]
SpongeBob: Class just isn't the same without Mrs. Puff. Just the thought of her alone and afraid in jail makes me think about her being alone and afraid in jail. I don't know how she's going to survive. [scene cuts to Mrs. Puff with a happy expression]
Mrs. Puff: [hums while breaking rocks. Scene cuts to her making license plates] ♪Smelling the pretty roses, whoo hoo hoo.♪ [scene cuts to her lifting weights] ♪Haaapiness is just two kinds of ice creeeeam!♪ [cuts back to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Oh, that poor woman. And it's all my fault. Maybe if I go talk to Patrick, he can ease my guilt. [scene cuts to the outside of Patrick's rock]
Patrick: Well, it sounds like it's all your fault.
SpongeBob: Oh, you're right! Mrs. Puff's in jail and it's all because of me! I'm such a barnacle head! [Patrick takes one of his dots and puts it in the place of where his nose would be if he had one] Poor Mrs. Puff. I know, I gotta get her out! But to get her out of jail, first we gotta get in jail.
Patrick: How are we gonna do that? [scene cuts to the First Nautical Bank]
SpongeBob: Alright, put the money in the bag! [SpongeBob is in the bank, wearing a sock over his head, with a bag in his hands, facing the wrong way. He yells] Put it in!
Bank Teller: Umm, you're facing the wrong way, sir.
SpongeBob: [turns around then laughs. Yells again] Alright, give me the money!
Bank Teller: Will that be from your savings or your checking account, sir?
SpongeBob: Uhh, savings.
Bank Teller: May I please see some identification?
SpongeBob: Sure. [takes out a card and gives it to the bank teller] Here ya go.
Bank Teller: Thank you. [SpongeBob's Jellyfishers Club Membership card is shown. As the bank teller types on the cash register, SpongeBob lifts up the sock on his head and gives Patrick a thumbs up] Sir, we are showing a balance of zero dollars and zero cents for both of your accounts.
SpongeBob: Oh.
Bank Teller: Next! [SpongeBob and Patrick walk out of the bank]
SpongeBob: Well, that went better than expected.
Patrick: Yeah! I didn't think we'd get Mrs. Puff out of jail this fast! [SpongeBob's eyes rip through the sock. Scene cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick disguised as yellow and pink rocks]
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Patrick, we'll get into jail this time. [a truck full of rocks drives up]
Fish: Hey, there's a couple. [gets out and throws the two rocks in the truck]
Guard: Put your back in it, girls! [women prisoners are crushing rocks outside. The truck arrives and unloads more rocks]
SpongeBob: Look, Patrick, there she is! [both jump over to Mrs. Puff where she is about to hit them] Mrs. Puff, wait, it's us, SpongeBob and Patrick!
Mrs. Puff: That's funny. For a second, I thought that yellow rock talked to me. And its voice sounded a lot like...
SpongeBob: SpongeBob. It's me, SpongeBob. [Mrs. Puff screams as she throws the pickaxe behind her] We're gonna bust you out of here. C'mon, Mrs. Puff! [Mrs. Puff starts shaking]
Mrs. Puff: It's you. What are you doing here? Why did you follow me in here? Why?! [one of the guards walks up, with Mrs. Puff's pickaxe in his head]
Guard : Alright, Mrs. Puff, it seems like this heat's gone to your head. If you're gonna talk to rocks, I guess it's time for you to go on kitchen duty.
Mrs. Puff: Yes, it must be the heat. Yes. [walks off]
SpongeBob: Darn it! Okay, Patrick, let's get out of here. [a woman prisoner walks over] No, wait! [she smashes the two rocks into pieces] There goes our deposit on these costumes. [scene cuts to lunchtime where Mrs. Puff is serving chili to the prisoners.]
Mrs. Puff: There you are. [A woman with a deep voice walks up to Mrs. Puff]
Woman: Hey there, Puff Mama. What's today's grub?
Mrs. Puff: Hi, Donna. It's chili, same as always. Let me get you some. [scoops up SpongeBob's nose]
SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff, it's me, SpongeBob!
Mrs. Puff: When are these horrific hallucinations going to end? [SpongeBob gets out of the chili]
SpongeBob: No, it's really me! [pulls Patrick up out of the chili] I brought Patrick along too.
Patrick: Hi.
Mrs. Puff: Why?
SpongeBob: 'Cause we're gonna set you free!
Mrs. Puff: No, I mean, why'd you bring him? [Patrick eats some chili]
SpongeBob: He likes chili. Now quick, get in before someone sees. [makes a rectangle-shaped entrance in the chili]
Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob, I am not going with you.
SpongeBob: [laughs] That's a good one, Mrs. Puff. Now hop in. Come on!
Patrick: SpongeBob, I think she means it.
SpongeBob: Oh, that's crazy, Patrick.
Mrs. Puff: He's right, SpongeBob. I'm staying.
SpongeBob: But why?
Mrs. Puff: I like it here. These are my people! [cut to a shot of some angry, gruff looking woman prisoners] And besides, if I'm in here, that means I won't have to deal with yooou... [we see SpongeBob sad. He is sniffling as a single teardrop falls from his eye] ...uranium! In the water supply. [she whips out a glass of water] See? Crystal clear! [she guzzles the water and tosses away the glass] Aahhhh!
SpongeBob: Excuse us for just one second, Mrs. Puff. [to Patrick] Patrick, she has lost it! She's completely institutionalized. She's forgotten what it's like to live on the outside. To not be in prison. [scene cuts to Frankie Billy in traffic then at his desk at work and then staring out his bedroom window]
Frankie's wife: Coming to bed, honey?
Frankie Billy: Yes, dear. [scene cuts back to SpongeBob and Patrick]
SpongeBob: We've got to remind her that there is a life other than this. Mrs. Puff, if you come with us, I'll stay after school and decorate the whole classroom.
Mrs. Puff: For the last time, no! [SpongeBob and Patrick disappear inside the chili as a guard walks up] I'm not going with you! That's final! [notices the guard] Oh. [laughs nervously]
Guard : Talking to inanimate objects again, huh, Puff? Hmph. Get back to your cell. No more kitchen time for you. [Mrs. Puff walks off sad. SpongeBob and Patrick watch her. Scene cuts to Mrs. Puff burning coal into wire hangers until SpongeBob and Patrick come down the conveyor belt]
SpongeBob: Quick, Mrs. Puff, hop on!
Mrs. Puff: Guards! Guards, come quick. [The guards run over to her] There's a crazed ex-student of mine and his overweight friend here to break me out!
Guard : That's just raw material used to make coat hangers. You need some rest. [Grunts as he pushes the level down, squishing SpongeBob and Patrick, which fills the room with steam. Scene cuts to Mrs. Puff brushing her teeth. SpongeBob and Patrick come up from the toilet]
SpongeBob: Psst! [Mrs. Puff screams] Hop in, Mrs. Puff.
Mrs. Puff: Guards! Guards, come look! [guard runs over and sees SpongeBob and Patrick in the toilet]
Guard : Whoa. They don't pay me enough to do this job. [The guard flushes the toilet. Cuts to Mrs. Puff in her bed. SpongeBob and Patrick peek from the top bunk]
SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff, up here.
Mrs. Puff: Guards, guards! They're back! [two guards walk up]
Guard : What's all the hubbub, Puff?
Mrs. Puff: They're back! [guards remove their heads showing them as SpongeBob and Patrick]
SpongeBob & Patrick: Mrs. Puff, it's us! [both wink and give her a thumbs up]
Mrs. Puff: [screams and cries as the real two guards run up]
Guard : What the barnacle is going on?
Mrs. Puff: Get away from me! Get away!
Guard : What are you talking about, Puff?
Mrs. Puff: You can't fool me! You're SpongeBob and that guy who likes the chili. [rips off the guards' faces leaving their skulls shown]
Guard : Let's face it, Puff, you've gone off the deep end. [scene cuts to the guards throwing Mrs. Puff, who is in a straitjacket, in a small square room] Get in there, you! You need a nice long stay in solitary confinement! [slams the door, which makes a squeaking sound]
Mrs. Puff: Oh well. Let's look at the positives again. I'm finally away from those two. Yes. All alone in my nice, soft room.
SpongeBob: Made of sponge! [laughs. The room is made of yellow sponge as SpongeBob's face appears on all sides of the wall. Mrs. Puff screams as the scene goes back to SpongeBob driving in mid-air with the police behind them.] I can pass the test, Mrs. Puff! I can pass the test! [The boat crashes into the truck full of punch, knocking it over, and spilling again]
Officer Malley: Freeze! Your joyride's over, punk. [police officers walk over]
Mrs. Puff: No! What? [policemen grab SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: No! What are you doing? Help! Help! [As the officers carry him to the jail vehicle, he kicks his legs.] No, no, please! I have a snail to feed! I can't go to jail now! This is not a good time! No, please, please! I'm not a criminal! [They throw him into the back of the police car, then drive off]
Mrs. Puff: I can't believe it. It was all a dream. I'm not going to jail!
Officer Malley: Why would you go to jail? You already did your time. [zoom out to reveal Mrs. Puff wearing prison striped clothes with a ball chained to her ankle. She screams as the scene goes back to her screaming while the boat is in mid-air]
Mrs. Puff: Oh, it's just my imagination again. [zooms over to show Donna driving the boat]
Donna: So what's for dinner tonight, Puff Mama? Chili? [Mrs. Puff screams again as the scene goes back to SpongeBob driving in mid-air]
Mrs. Puff: Huh? What? Huh? Ah, forget it.
